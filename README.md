## What the notebook does
- Loads a public dataset (Pima Indians Diabetes)
- Prepares features and target
- Creates an age-based sensitive attribute
- Splits the data
- Trains a logistic regression model
- Evaluates accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Runs fairness metrics with Fairlearn
- Creates SHAP summary values
- Generates a LIME explanation
- Saves the trained model

## How to run
